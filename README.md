Some simple samples
=====================

The motivation: [Playing with some free files to do some map reduce stuff operations]

###  LIST
* BigFileCounter
* Movie Rating
* OccurenceCounter : use a Trigramme function to build trigramme with each line on a file, then count each occurence from filename_16
use references to detect trigramme from candidate filename
